It is a back in application. So name of our application is coursering app here. Teacher teacher can create course, any student can search any course, and if they will why they can buy, they can create their user account. They can search how many courses they are buyed Which teacher created which course they have access to edit their course.
And I added login authentication system like jwd, be using b grip. I has the password so it is secured. As well as I did hot validation show, no one can able to manipulate your authentication cycle and access your database. That's what I did in the entire application.So it is complete.I don't say it is completed, but it's just secure
